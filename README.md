# ShiftPay Documentation

Welcome to the documentation repository for ShiftPay. This repository contains all the detailed documentation related to the project, including system design, functional requirements, technical specifications, user stories, wireframes, and more.

## Project Overview

**ShiftPay** is a digital platform designed to keep track of **weekly income** and **working hours** based on shift work. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for workers to manage their earnings efficiently.

### Problem Statement

Shift workers often face difficulties in tracking their hours and income accurately, especially when dealing with irregular hours, varying rates, and unpaid breaks. This can lead to missed payments, inaccurate pay calculations, and a lack of work-life balance. **ShiftPay** provides a streamlined solution for workers to track their time and income efficiently.

### Target Audience

- **Shift Workers**: Individuals working hourly or irregular shifts who need to track both their time and earnings.
- **Freelancers**: Workers with flexible schedules and multiple employers who require accurate tracking of hours and pay.

### Key Features

- **Track earnings** based on hourly rates.
- **Record working hours** for accurate time tracking.
- **Manage shift patterns** and monitor work-life balance.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a central place for all the documentation related to the ShiftPay. It provides an in-depth view of the functionality, architecture, and design decisions that went into building the project. The docs are structured as follows:

- **Functional Requirements**: Describes the key features and functionalities of the project.
- **Technical Design**: Provides details on how the system is implemented, including technology stack, database structure, and API design.
- **Wireframes**: Visual representations of the user interface (UI) design.
- **User Stories**: A breakdown of user interactions and use cases for the system.
- **API Design**: Details the API endpoints, request/response structures, and authentication methods used in the backend.

## Functional Requirements

The **Functional Requirements** section outlines the main features of the application. This includes:
- Task management (create, read, update, delete tasks)

You can read the full **Functional Requirements** document [here](docs/functional-requirements.md).

## Technical Design

This section explains the technical aspects of the project, including:
- The chosen technology stack
- System architecture and components
- Data flow and interactions between different layers of the system

To dive deeper, view the full **Technical Design** document [here](docs/technical-design.md).

## System Architecture

This section use C4 Model provides a visual diagram and process flow of the system architecture, including the backend, frontend, and database interactions.

You can view the **System Architecture** diagram and details [here](https://s.icepanel.io/6Gly5HmgeLhqbo/1TFX).

## API Design

This section describes the API endpoints used in the project. It includes:
- RESTful API structure
- Detailed explanation of each API endpoint, its request and response formats, and any authentication methods (such as JWT).

For detailed API documentation, check out the **API Design** document [here](docs/api-design.md).

## Wireframes

Wireframes are provided to showcase the user interface design and flow. These wireframes help visualise the key screens of the application and user interactions.

You can view the **Wireframes** folder [here](docs/wireframes/).

## User Stories

This section defines the interactions between the user and the system through user stories. It captures how the system behaves from a user's perspective.

Check out the full **User Stories** document [here](docs/user-stories.md).

## Testing

The **Testing** section outlines the various tests conducted for the project, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. It also includes instructions for setting up and running tests.

You can access the **Testing** documentation [here](docs/testing.md).
